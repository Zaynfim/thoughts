When the child is skillful, he boasts.
When the warrior is skillful, he teaches.

When the child is strong, he attacks the weak.
When the warrior is strong, he protects the weak.

The child criticizes others to make himself feel better.
The warrior is his own most demanding critic.

The child brandishes symbols as a substitute for substance.
The warrior knows that it is not his position, his rank, his 
education or his warfare pin that makes him a man, but his honor.

The child serves himself.
The warrior serves others.

The child relishes gossip.
The warrior speaks through action.

The child never makes mistakes.
The warrior admits his mistakes and corrects them.

The child's character is cloudy.
The warrior's character is clear.

If the child recognizes that he needs teaching, then one day
he can become a warrior. 
When the warrior meets the child, he seeks to teach him.
